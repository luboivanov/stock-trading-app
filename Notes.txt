Testing:
	no buy/sell, flat prices - 2024-07-01T10:00:20Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:25Z
	no buy/sell, descending prices - 2024-07-01T10:00:26Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:29Z
	typical scenario - 00 to 38, buy at 01, sell at 04
	equal profit, earrlier deal - 2024-07-01T10:00:01Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:11Z -> to return 01 to 04
	???equal profit, same sell date, shorter duration (later buy date) 2024-07-01T10:00:30Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:34Z

test the UI:

	http://localhost:3001/

run BE unit tests:
	cd c:\Projects\FullStackStockApp\backend>
	npm run test -- --coverage
	BE unit test wjest 

run FE unit tests:
	go to c:\Projects\FullStackStockApp\frontend>
	npm test -- --coverage

run Cypress E2E tests:
	go to c:\Projects\FullStackStockApp\frontend>
	npx cypress open - opens the UI
	npx cypress run - to run in the console

ToDo:
//fraction shares


Production ready DONE:
	Functionally ready with 2 bonus features (fractional shareas and date/time selector with seconds for precise trade time selection)
	Unit tests
		Frontend - 97% coverage
		Backend - 93% coverage
	E2E testing
		Cypress, 5 tests
	Version control - Git locally + GitHub
	Dev environment on localhost
	Production in the cloud - hosted at Render.com 
	Automatically deployed in a container (managed by Render, Docker-like)
	Ready for horizontal scaling (Render Dashboard → Service → Scaling → Manual Scaling)
		Manual scaling up to 3 instances (requires non-free pack)
		Auto scaling (requires expensive Pro pack)
	Automatic Reverse Proxy and CDN by Render
		Render uses Content Delivery Network (CDN) - automatically distributes static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) across data centers worldwide.
		Render's CDN acts as Reverse Proxy 
			Accepts the incoming HTTPS requests
			Serves from cache whenever possible (css, images, etc)
			Forwards the request to your Render server
	CI/CD - GitHub Actions:
		automatically builds and triggers backend and frontend unit tests and Cypress E2E
		email notifications on failed tests
		automated deployment for frontend and backend 
	Backend healthCheck
		at /api/health with TerminusModule 
		Render.com checks app health after every deployment 
		Restarts the backend if it becomes unresponsive
	Swagger for API docs, available at /api#/App/AppController_getBestTrade
	HTTPS for all endpoints in the cloud - backend, frontend, swagger, health checks
	Environment variables (REACT_APP_API_URL)
	CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled since the frontend (React app) and backend (NestJS) apps run on different ports and domains
	Linter (ESLint) for code quality & correctness
		Covers both front-end and back-end and even E2E Cypress tests
		Added as part of the CI workflow in GitHub Actions

	Accessibility basic coverage for users with motor disabilities (use the UI with keyboard only). 



Production ready TODO:
	Prettier (installed, needs tuning)
	Integrate linters (ESLint, Stylelint) and code formatters (Prettier).
	Security & Observability — 
		Add logging, library like @nestjs/terminus or Winston., Log errors and key events.
		rate limiting (e.g., @nestjs/throttler) to prevent abuse., 
		Monitoring - Monitor uptime, integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana
		Telemetry (optional)
	Deployment Monitoring - Use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or LogRocket/Sentry for observability.
	Documentation
		Document the API using Swagger (you already did — ensure it's clean).
		Provide a README explaining:
			Project purpose
			How to run frontend/backend
			How to test
			How to deploy
		Architecture diagram (Miro)
		Deployment diagram (Miro)
		Deployment flow description
		Readme.md in GitHub
		Updload requirements


Prod Ready Low prio and Not needed
	Secrets Management (GitHub) - not applicable for the project
	Load Balancer - not needed atm, could be done once scaling to multiple instances or when custom routing logic is needed(e.g., multiple services behind one domain)
	Reverse proxy (nginx or other) - not needed atm, Render is automatically doing Reverse proxying from the public URL to the internal service.
	API mocks (Stubs) - not urgent as frontend is integrated and running against the actual backend in CI and local dev and already testing the full stack (unit + E2E) with real APIs
	CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) - not needed as the API is stateless and does not use cookies for authentication
	Session fixation filter (to prevent from cases when attacker sets or predicts a user's session ID before they log in) - not needed as no sessions are implemented
	Serve both backend and frontend under one domain.
	Full Accessibility - including users with visual impairment 
	Localization and Internationalization
	Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
	Automatically create git tags/releases on successful merges.
	Canary or blue/green deployments
