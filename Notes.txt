npm run start:dev


Testing:
no buy/sell, flat prices - 2024-07-01T10:00:20Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:25Z
no buy/sell, descending prices - 2024-07-01T10:00:26Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:29Z
typical scenario - 00 to 38, buy at 01, sell at 04
equal profit, earrlier deal - 2024-07-01T10:00:01Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:11Z -> to return 01 to 04
???equal profit, same sell date, shorter duration (later buy date) 2024-07-01T10:00:30Z to 2024-07-01T10:00:34Z

ToDo:
open api, stub
//fraction shares
xsrf

Production ready:
reverse proxy via NGINX or Traefik.
Host on a provider like Render, DigitalOcean, AWS, Vercel, etc.
CI/CD - Set up GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / CircleCI:
HTTPS

xsrf
Session fixation filter?
telemetry?
Enable CORS properly (e.g., restrict to known frontend domains).
Add a rate limiter (e.g., @nestjs/throttler) to prevent abuse.
Use a logging library like @nestjs/terminus or Winston., 
Log errors and key events.
Consider adding health checks.
Deployment Monitoring - Use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or LogRocket/Sentry for observability.
Documentation
	Document the API using Swagger (you already did â€” ensure it's clean).
	Provide a README explaining:
	Project purpose
	How to run frontend/backend
	How to test
	How to deploy


Prod Ready Low prio
	Accessibility
	Localization and Internationalization
